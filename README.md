# Predicting_Heart_Disease

This notebook will introduce some foundation machine learning and data science concepts by exploring the problem of heart disease classification.
The following machine learning modelling framework will b used:
* Exploratory Data Analysis
* Model Training
* Model Evaluation
* Model Comparison
* Model fine-tuning
* Feature Importance
* Cross validation

Given clinical parameters about a patient, can we predict whether or not they have heart disease?
